# [Elite-Ecom](https://elite-ecom.netlify.app/)

This is an E-Commerce site for food lovers mostly built using [Elite-UI](https://elite-ui.netlify.app/).   
I want people to make it marketplace where food lovers can suggest their favourite dish and others can order it.

# Website Breakdown

[**HomePage**](https://elite-ecom.netlify.app/): It has a navbar with a hero logo and navigation links to different parts of the Website.  
Currently, clicking on image of the homepage will take you the **product listing page**.

I have used to details and summary tag for filter for making the page look better when viewed from mobile.

[**Cart-Management**](https://elite-ecom.netlify.app/cartpage/cart.html): Clicking on the cart icon of the navbar will redirect you this page where you can remove items from the cart or proceed to buy them.

[**Wishlist-Management**](https://elite-ecom.netlify.app/wishlist-page/wishlist.html): Clicking on the heart icon of the navbar will redirect you this page where you can move elements to the cart or remove them from the wishlist.

[**Authentication**](https://elite-ecom.netlify.app/auth-page/auth.html): Last icon on the navbar takes you to this page where you can login/sign-up and once you login. You can see a logout button which will bring you back to the homepage.
